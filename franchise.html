            <h3 class="naslov">God of War 2005</h3>
            <p>The game that kicked off this larger-than-life series, God of War, sees Kratos tasked with killing his former master Ares after 10 years of serving the gods - which requires the elusive Pandora's Box.
            God of War introduced players to the franchise's signature combo-based hack and slash combat, and is widely regarded as one of the best games on the PS2. It was remastered for the PS3 in 2009 as part of the God of War Collection.

        <h3 class="naslov">God of War 2007</h3>
        <p>A late PS2 release, God of War 2 follows a bitter Kratos as he leads his Spartan army on a rampage across Greece which soon worries the Olympians and causes Zeus to intervene. Kratos then spends the game on a quest to get revenge on Zeus, leading to revelations for Kratos, the Titans and the Gods themselves.
             God of War 2 received similar critical acclaim to its predecessor and was soon ported to the PS3 in 2009 as part of the God of War Collection.</p>

        <h3 class="naslov">God of War Betreyal</h3>
        <p>An early attempt to replicate console games on mobile, God of War: Betrayal is a 2D side-scroller that follows Kratos on a bloodthirsty quest to clear his name after being framed for murder.
             Despite fan speculation, God of War: Betrayal has been confirmed to be canon, although the game seems very tricky to find these days. Videos like the one above can help you get a feel for it, though.</p>

        <p>God of War's first entry on the PSP, God of War: Chains of Olympus, follows Kratos around five years into his service to the Gods. The 2008 title sees Kratos investigate the abduction of the Sun God Helios, which leads to him unravelling a conspiracy in the underworld.
             God of War: Chains of Olympus became one of the most critically acclaimed PSP games of all time with particular praise directed towards the controls, and was later ported to the PS3 as part of God of War: Origins Collection.</p>

            With a revamped magic system and more enemies, God of War 3 was also critically acclaimed and was remastered for the PS4 in 2015.</p>

        <p>Despite being the seventh instalment in the series and the last release of the Greek era, God of War: Ascension is actually a prequel to the entire series. Six months after breaking his blood oath to Ares, Ascension sees Kratos imprisoned by the three Furies and learn the truth about his bond with the God of War.
            2013's God of War: Ascension is also the only game in the series to feature multiplayer, which included both cooperative and competitive online modes with new gameplay mechanics.</p>

        <p>God of War: Mimir's Vision is not a full game either, but rather an iOS and Android AR game released as part of the promotion for the 2018 God of War.

        <p>This iconic entry sees the famously angry Kratos reimagined as an older, more reflective character attempting to put his past behind him with his new wife Faye and son Atreus in the Norse world. However, when Faye passes away, Kratos goes on a quest to spread her ashes, teaching Atreus key life lessons along the way.
            The gameplay was also reimagined, with the magical Leviathan Axe replacing the usual double-chained blades, an over-the-shoulder free camera and RPG elements. 
            The best-selling PS4 game and winner of numerous Game of the Year awards, God of War was universally critically praised. The God of War PC port was released in 2022.</p>
